# nosql-challenge

In this activity, I was requested to create a NoSQL MongoDB database called "uk_food" and a collection called "establishments". 
Then, I imported the establishments json file and worked with PyMongo, Pandas and Pretty Print to update the database and perform exploratory analysis on the data provided:

* CRUD - Update database:
